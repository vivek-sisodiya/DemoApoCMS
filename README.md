# Apostrophe 3 headless demo

## Get started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. At the moment, you must have a local copy of `apostrophe` using the `3.0` branch and link that to this project. In whatever local directory you keep your dev work in, run:
   1. `git clone git@github.com:apostrophecms/apostrophe.git && cd apostrophe`
   2. `git fetch && git checkout 3.0` to get on the correct branch.
   3. `npm link` to set Apostrophe up for linking in the project.
3. Back in the `a3-demo` project, link up Apostrophe: `npm link apostrophe`.

## Running the project

Run `npm run dev` to build the Apostrophe UI and start the site up. Remember, this is during alpha development, so we're all in "dev mode."
